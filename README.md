# 📊 Socioeconomic Determinants of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) Usage

This project explores the patterns of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) service adoption in the United States using a nationally representative survey of 11,400 individuals. The analysis uses logistic regression modeling and diagnostic tests to examine how **education, age, and income** influence the likelihood of using BNPL.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Young, mid-income individuals (age 30–44, income $25K–$50K)** show the highest probability (~22%) of using BNPL.
- **Graduate degree holders** are significantly less likely to use BNPL, suggesting stronger credit access or financial caution.
- **BNPL is primarily used as a liquidity tool**, not just for luxury spending.

These findings have **strategic implications** for both **fintech firms** and **policy design**:
- Fintech companies can optimize customer segmentation and risk assessment.
- Policymakers can better target financial literacy and consumer protection efforts.

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Data**: Cross-sectional, nationally representative financial behavior survey (2024)
- **Sample Size**: 11,400 individuals

- **Independent Variables**: Categorical indicators for age group, income bracket, and education level
- **Model**: Logistic regression using Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- **Diagnostics**:
  - Pseudo R² = 0.032
  - LLR p-value < 0.001
  - VIF < 2 for all covariates
